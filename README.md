''Important Notice - Do not use the version that Pascal66 has forked on github as i cannot support his changes.
he's basically gone removed all the credits and deleted a feature asked by the users here that supports development.
there is no difference besides from the node version it runs.
his node v6 & v7 fork breaks backwards compatibility with mine at the cost of no additional features.''

- I never ask this guy to support my code, because first he didnt know how to code, and I'm able to support myself what I produce.
- The old code has at least two majors bugs, that make unusable the pool in middle/long term (never corrected, and make loose money for the owner of this pool), nobody want to know which one, that strange.
- Has features that doesnt correspond to free and open source laws, free mean free for all, open mean open for all.
- Our code doesnt break any backwards compatibility, as we didnt touch the client part, just only give the owners of pool the opportunity to follow the evolution of the nodejs team.

As we doesnt allow use of this branch, code is removed, to avoid use of equitable work, and let users of pools to made there choice, and we are sure, in a long term, our code is a better choice than the modified only for profit one.

Burst-Pool Dev branch. Only for Educational search.
Fully nodev6 compatible - Fully IPv6 compatible.

We didnt ask any credit for this evolution and more bug free than older work, this work is only to help the community of BURST.
