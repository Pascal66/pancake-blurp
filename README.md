''Important Notice - Do not use the version that Pascal66 has forked on github as i cannot support his changes.
he's basically gone removed all the credits and deleted a feature asked by the users here that supports development.
there is no difference besides from the node version it runs.
his node v6 & v7 fork breaks backwards compatibility with mine at the cost of no additional features.''

Unfortunatly, the SOELexicon code has at least two majors bugs, that make unusable the pool in middle/long term (in profit of the owner, and never corrected), has features that doesnt correspond to free and open source laws, and the evolution of our code doesnt break any backwards compatibility, as we didnt touch the client part, just only give the owners of pool to follow the evolution of the nodejs team.

As we doesnt allow use of this branch, code is removed, to avoid use of equitable work, and let users of pools to made there choice, and we are sure, in a long term, our code is a better choice than the modified only for profit one.
