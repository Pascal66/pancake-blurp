''Important Notice - Do not use the version that Pascal66 has forked on github as i cannot support his changes.
he's basically gone removed all the credits and deleted a feature asked by the users here that supports development.
there is no difference besides from the node version it runs.
his node v6 & v7 fork breaks backwards compatibility with mine at the cost of no additional features.''

- I never ask this guy to support my code, because first he didnt know how to code, and second, we are able to support what we produce.
- The old code has at least two majors bugs, that make unusable the pool in middle/long term (never corrected, and make loose money for the owner of this pool), nobody want to know which one, that strange to focus only at devFee and poor debug part (the only additional unusefull features), and not for what that doesnt work.
- The old code has features that doesnt correspond to free and open source laws, free mean free for all, open mean open for all.
- Our code doesnt break any backwards compatibility, as we didnt touch the client part, just only give the owners of pool the opportunity to follow the evolution of the nodejs team, we are at 7.x not at 4.y wich isnt supported anymore at any time.

As we doesnt allow use of this branch, code is removed, to avoid use of equitable work, and let users of pools to made there choice, and we are sure, in a long term, our code is a better choice than the modified only for profit one. 
We are going to not give any clue about the major uncorrected bugs that made loose money for any owner of the previous code, because we dont want to go in a steril discussion.

Burst-Pool Dev branch. Only for Educational search.
Fully nodev6 compatible - Fully IPv6 compatible.

We didnt ask any credit for this evolution and more bugs free than older work, this work is only to help the community of BURST (Doesnt it want any help ?)
