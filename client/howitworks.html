    <title>How this Burst Pool works</title>
</head>
<body>
<ul>
    <li><b>Minimum payout is 250 Burst</b></li>
    <li><b>Pool fee is 1.5%</b></li>
    <li><b>Transaction fee is 0.5%</b> (or minimum 1 burst as required by the network)</li>
    <li><b>Payment is instant when pool has positive a balance</b></li>
    <li><b>Share value reduction is 50% per block</b></li>
        <p> If the pool does not forge the Block at the current round, all the miners shares are kept up to 50 blocks,
            but their value is reduced by 50% each Round we do not forge a Block.
            If the pool does forge a Block, all shares are summed up to the current Block Number and
            payed out propotional to the summed up shares of each miner.
        </p>
    <li><b>Block forward allocation is 50%</b></li>
        <p> If pool has a balance (lets say 10000 Burst),
            5000 are distributed to the miners proportional to their shares up to current block as described above.
            The other 5000 Burst will be allocated and paid in the next round, (whether we forge a block or not),
            this allocation continues until the pool balance has drained out.
        </p>
    <li><b>No Deadline limit</b></li>
        <p> The deadline value from miners is converted into a share value using this equation<br/>
            share = 1000 / ( NetDiff * Deadline + 1 ) <sup>0.75</sup><br/>
            where NetDiff (network difficulty) is calculated by Block0-BaseTarget / Block#N-BaseTarget<br/><br/>
            <b>note</b> : to prevent users spamming low shares, we implemented a share penalty of -0.001 for each submission
            with an higher deadline then the miners own current best deadline!
            Spamming low deadlines is usles sinse the pool will always pick the best submitted deadline from each miner in a round.
